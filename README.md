A tool to track your team's hours during the season, using barcodes or QR codes that can be quickly scanned as team members come and go.

It will output CSV files with daily hours for each team member for mentors and students, which can easily be turned into a pivot table to get summaries of time spent.

It also includes the ability to show time until ship.

QR codes or barcode (Code 128 or Code 39 only) data must be in the form of "LastName, FirstName" for a student, and "Mentor LastName, FirstName" for a mentor.

Right-click the interface for some options.

If a file named "Background.jpg" is included in the directory with the executable, it will be displayed under the clock.
